We introduce **GarmentLab**, a unified simulation and benchmark designed to address the complexities of garment manipulation. Here are the key features and contributions of GarmentLab:

- **Realistic Simulation**: Built on **NVIDIAâ€™s Isaac Sim**, GarmentLab offers a highly-paralleled data collection pipeline and realistic rendering, supporting various sensors and robot operating systems (ROS). The simulation methods include Particle-Based Dynamics (PBD) and Finite Element Method (FEM) for diverse garment types, allowing for precise simulation of garment dynamics.

- **Diverse Task Coverage**: GarmentLab supports a wide range of tasks involving interactions between garments, deformable objects, rigid bodies, fluids, and human bodies. It covers 11 categories of garments and includes various robotic manipulators, providing 20 tasks across 5 groups, including garment-garment and garment-avatar interactions.

- **Extensive Dataset and Assets**: The benchmark includes a large-scale dataset of garments, robot models, and 3D assets. It features 20 scenes and over 9000 object models, ensuring rich simulation content and diverse task scenarios.

- **Sim-to-Real Gap Bridging**: To address the sim-to-real challenge, GarmentLab integrates methods like Teleoperation and Visual Sim-Real Alignment. These techniques enhance the real-world applicability of trained models by aligning simulation with real-world data.

- **Open Source and Community Contribution**: GarmentLab aims to be an open-source project, providing comprehensive analysis and evaluation tools for future research. It supports the development of robust algorithms for garment manipulation by offering a realistic simulation environment and a rich set of assets.

This benchmark serves as a robust platform for advancing the field of robotic garment manipulation, providing researchers with the tools to explore and develop new methods for this challenging domain.

We provide brief guidance on this page. Please refer to [our documentation](https://garmentlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about <tt>garmentlab</tt>.
